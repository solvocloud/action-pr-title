# PR Title GitHub Action

This Action ensures that the PR title begins with a valid JIRA item (bug, task, issue etc).

**Notes**

1. This is not just a syntax check; a call is made to JIRA to validate that such an issue exists.
2. This is a public repository by design. In the future, it may be converted to an internal repository.
